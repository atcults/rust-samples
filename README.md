# Rust Learning Repository

This repository is dedicated to learning the Rust programming language. It contains a collection of code examples to illustrate various Rust concepts and features.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```
    (Replace `<repository_url>` and `<repository_directory>` with the actual URL and directory name)

2.  **Navigate to an example:**
    Examples will be organized in directories (once added). You'll `cd` into the specific example's directory.

3.  **Run the example:**
    Most examples can be run using Cargo, Rust's package manager and build system:
    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```

## Examples

This section will be updated with links to or descriptions of the examples as they are added. Currently, the repository contains a basic "Hello, world!" application in `src/main.rs`.

## Contributing

This repository is primarily for personal learning. However, if you have simple, illustrative examples that you think would be beneficial, feel free to suggest them.
